## Context for Future Sessions

This is a Telegram Mini App for cricket/crypto predictions. The app has gamification features working (spins, streaks, referrals, leaderboards, wallet connection). The goal is to integrate a prediction market from themoon.business and add an onboarding tutorial.

Key constraints:
- TON blockchain only (Telegram mandate)
- Trading framing, not betting (regulatory)
- Play-first architecture (wallet unlocks later)
