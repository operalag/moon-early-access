- TypeScript discriminated union types for 5 slide variants (intro, concept, quiz, action, reward)
- Module 1 "The Kit Bag" content with 6 slides using Cricket metaphors
- Module 2 and 3 placeholders (locked state)

**Depends on:** Phase 11
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: SlideEngine with swipe/arrow navigation and all 5 slide type renderers
- [x] 12-02: Quiz haptic feedback and confetti integration

**Details:**
- SlideEngine carousel with framer-motion drag gestures and AnimatePresence
- Swipe detection (50px threshold OR 500px/s velocity)

### Phase 14: Menu & Gating

**Goal:** Add Net Practice entry point to main menu with attention indicator and locked module teasers
**Depends on:** Phase 13
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 14-01: useEducationStatus hook, BottomNav with Net Practice tab and indicator, ModuleCard wallet-lock teaser

**Details:**
- Net Practice tab (5th) in BottomNav with GraduationCap icon
- useEducationStatus hook for indicator state logic
- Pulsing yellow indicator when education incomplete AND no wallet connected
- Module 2+ locked with "Connect wallet to unlock" teaser
- Module 1 exempt from wallet gating (teaches wallet connection)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Points not XP: Single currency using existing points engine (Rationale: Simpler, consistent)
- Static JSON content: education_modules.json for easy updates without redeploy
- Module 2+ wallet-gated: Incentivize wallet connection (Module 1 teaches connection)
- Incremental release: Ship Module 1 first, validate before Modules 2 & 3
- Discriminated union pattern: Type-safe slide variant handling
- Service-role only RLS: All progress access via server-side API
- Haptic in QuizSlide, confetti in SlideEngine: Separation of concerns
- Points failure non-fatal: Completion tracking is primary concern
- AND logic for indicator: Show only when BOTH education incomplete AND no wallet

**Issues Resolved:**

- All 17 requirements satisfied (100% coverage)
- All 15 cross-phase exports properly integrated
- All 3 E2E user flows verified working

**Issues Deferred:**

- Module 2: "The Ticket & The Score" — TON vs USDT education (v6.1.0+)
- Module 3: "The Analyst vs. The Gambler" — Trading vs Betting (v6.1.0+)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None — all phases verified and passed without anti-patterns.
