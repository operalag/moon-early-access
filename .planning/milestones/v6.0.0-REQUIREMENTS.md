## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Video content in slides | Keep app lightweight, text + Lottie only |
| Practice/testnet trading | Real trades teach better per research |
| Separate XP currency | Single currency (points) simpler |
| User-generated modules | Moderation overhead, content quality |
| Audio narration | Telegram Mini App constraints, accessibility |
| Offline mode | Always connected in Telegram |
