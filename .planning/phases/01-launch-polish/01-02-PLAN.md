<objective>
Implement visual tweaks and page element reordering specified by user during Plan 01 checkpoint.

Purpose: Complete the launch polish phase by implementing the specific visual refinements the user requested after reviewing the leaderboard changes.

Output: All user-specified visual tweaks and page reordering changes applied and verified.

<conditional-execution>
This plan has conditional execution based on Plan 01 checkpoint output.

**Before starting tasks, read 01-01-SUMMARY.md and check:**

1. If SUMMARY contains "## User-Specified Requirements" section with specific tweaks:
   - Parse the requirements
   - Create implementation tasks dynamically (see task template below)
   - Execute the tasks

2. If SUMMARY indicates "approved - no additional polish" or no requirements specified:
   - Skip this plan entirely
   - Create a brief SUMMARY noting "No additional polish requested"
   - Phase 01 is complete

**Task template for each visual tweak:**
```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Task N: [Description from user requirement]</name>
  <files>[File path(s) affected]</files>
  <action>
[Specific changes from user requirement]
- Locate the element/component
- Apply the specified change
- Maintain existing functionality
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` to ensure no errors. Visual inspection confirms change applied.
  </verify>
  <done>
[User requirement] implemented and visible.
  </done>
</task>
```

**Task template for page reordering:**
```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Task N: Reorder [page name] elements</name>
  <files>[Page file path]</files>
  <action>
Reorder elements on [page] as specified:
- Current order: [list current]
- New order: [list new per user spec]
- Move JSX blocks to achieve new order
- Maintain all functionality and props
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` to ensure no errors. Visual inspection confirms new order.
  </verify>
  <done>
[Page] elements reordered: [new order description].
  </done>
</task>
```
</conditional-execution>

<tasks>
<!-- Tasks are generated dynamically based on 01-01-SUMMARY.md content -->
<!-- The executor reads the SUMMARY, parses user requirements, and creates specific tasks -->

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Parse user requirements from Plan 01</name>
  <files>N/A (read-only)</files>
  <action>
Read `.planning/phases/01-launch-polish/01-01-SUMMARY.md` and extract:

1. **Visual tweaks** - Look for specific element/style changes
2. **Page reordering** - Look for layout order changes

If the SUMMARY indicates "no additional polish" or no requirements section exists:
- Create 01-02-SUMMARY.md with status "skipped - no requirements"
- Plan complete

If requirements exist:
- List each requirement as a discrete task
- Proceed to implement each one
  </action>
  <verify>
Requirements parsed and documented, or skip condition confirmed.
  </verify>
  <done>
User requirements extracted and ready for implementation (or plan skipped if none).
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2+: Implement user-specified changes</name>
  <files>[Determined by requirements]</files>
  <action>
For each requirement from Task 1:
- Identify the target file(s)
- Locate the specific element/component
- Apply the requested change (styling, ordering, etc.)
- Verify the change doesn't break existing functionality

Follow codebase conventions:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Existing component patterns
- No new dependencies without good reason
  </action>
  <verify>
`npm run build` passes. Visual inspection confirms change.
  </verify>
  <done>
All user-specified changes implemented.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- [ ] All visual tweaks from user requirements applied
- [ ] All page reordering from user requirements applied
- [ ] Build passes without errors
- [ ] No functionality broken by changes
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Every requirement specified in 01-01-SUMMARY.md is implemented
- Build passes
- Changes match user's specifications
- OR: Plan skipped because user specified no additional polish
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-launch-polish/01-02-SUMMARY.md`

Include:
- List of changes implemented (or note that plan was skipped)
- Files modified
- Any deviations from user specs (with explanation)
</output>
