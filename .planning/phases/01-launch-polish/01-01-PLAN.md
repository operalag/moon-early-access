<objective>
Remove @username from leaderboard entries and verify visual polish requirements.

Purpose: Ship a clean v1.0 release candidate with only name and avatar on leaderboard (privacy-friendly, cleaner UI). Additional visual tweaks to be specified during verification checkpoint.

Output: Leaderboard page displaying name + avatar without @username, plus user verification of overall polish.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove @username from leaderboard entries</name>
  <files>src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
In `src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx`, remove the username display from leaderboard entries.

Current code (lines 127-129):
```tsx
<p className="text-[10px] text-white/30 font-mono">
    @{user.username || 'anon'}
</p>
```

Remove these 3 lines entirely. The leaderboard entry should show:
- Rank (number or icon)
- Avatar (image or first initial)
- First name (user.first_name)
- Points

Do NOT modify:
- The LeaderboardEntry type (keep username field - API still returns it)
- The API call or data fetching logic
- The tabs or header
- Any other styling

The result should be a cleaner entry with just name and points visible to users.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` to ensure no TypeScript errors. Visually inspect the code to confirm the username paragraph element is removed.
  </verify>
  <done>
Leaderboard entry component no longer renders @username. Only first_name, avatar, and points are displayed for each user.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Verify leaderboard and specify additional polish</name>
  <what-built>
Leaderboard page with @username removed from entries. Each entry now shows only:
- Rank icon/number
- Avatar (photo or initial)
- Name (first_name)
- Points
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `npm run dev` and open the app in Telegram Web App test mode
2. Navigate to the Leaderboard page
3. Verify entries show name and avatar only (no @username visible)
4. Check all three tabs (All Time, This Week, Today)

After verifying leaderboard:
- If additional "visual tweaks" are needed, describe them specifically
- If "page element reordering" is needed, specify which pages and what order
- If no additional changes needed, type "approved"
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if leaderboard looks good and no additional polish needed.
OR describe specific visual tweaks and page reordering requirements for a follow-up plan.
  </resume-signal>
</task>
