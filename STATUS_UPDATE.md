## 1. Accomplishments

### 🏗️ Core Architecture (The "Super App" Model)
*   **Structure:** Migrated from a single-page app to a tabbed application using `BottomNav` navigation.
*   **Pillars:** Successfully integrated 3 core sections: Markets, AI Analyst, and News Intel.
*   **Design:** Upgraded UI to an "Award Winning" dark/glassmorphism aesthetic using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.

### 🏏 Dashboard (Markets)
*   **Core Features:** Wallet Connection (+1000 pts reward), Referral System ("Syndicate"), and Global Leaderboard.
*   **Gamification:**
    *   **Daily Spin:** A visual 1-second wheel with persistent labels, confetti effects, and 24h cooldown logic.
    *   **Progression:** "Road to Mainnet" progress bar tracking user onboarding milestones.
*   **Integrations:** Real-time data sync via Supabase and local storage checks for offline testing.

### 🤖 AI Analyst (Chat)
*   **Integration:** Fully functional Chatbase integration via Next.js API Proxy (`/api/chat`).
*   **Security:** API Keys hidden server-side; client uses internal endpoint.
*   **UX:** Chat interface with typing indicators, auto-scroll, and error handling.

### 📰 News Intel
*   **Source:** Live scraping of the `@cricketandcrypto` Telegram channel via public web preview.
*   **UI:** Feed view displaying the latest 5 posts inside the app.
*   **Engagement:** "Open Channel" deep link to drive subscribers to Telegram.

### ⚙️ Technical
*   **Environment:** deployed on Vercel with Environment Variables managed via CLI.
*   **Authentication:** Custom "Mock User" mode for browser testing + Telegram TWA `initData` support.
*   **Wallet:** TON Connect integrated with custom manifest.

## 2. Known Issues / Limitations
*   **Security:** The app currently trusts client-side `initData` (Safe for MVP, but needs backend validation for Mainnet).
*   **News:** Scraping reliant on Telegram's public web view structure; if Telegram changes HTML classes, the scraper breaks.
*   **Daily Spin:** Cooldown logic relies on a DB column `last_spin_at` which must be manually added to Supabase.
