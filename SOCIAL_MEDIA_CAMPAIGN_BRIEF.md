SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN BRIEF
Educational Content for Prediction Markets & ICC T20 World Cup 2026

================================================================================

1. OVERVIEW

About MOON

MOON is a Telegram mini-app that gamifies cricket prediction markets on the TON blockchain. Users earn "Strategy Points" through education, daily engagement, and referrals, which convert to real tokens at mainnet launch.

The Opportunity

The ICC T20 World Cup 2026 (February 7 - March 8, 2026) in India & Sri Lanka is one of cricket's biggest events. We're targeting cricket fans across South Asia, Australia, and the UK who want to engage with matches beyond just watching.

BAD:
"BET ON INDIA NOW!!! Easy money!!! Don't miss out!!!"

GOOD:
